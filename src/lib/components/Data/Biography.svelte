<h3>Astra Militarum</h3>
<p>After completing her training under the Scholastica Psykana, Pandora entered the ranks of the Astra Militarum to begin training as a Primaris Psyker. She served in the Imperial Navy for just over 7 years and was stationed primarily in the Calixis Sector. It was during this time that the Lord Captain first came into the public eye when she single-handedly saved a pilgrim ship by stopping a warp breach. Pandora was honorably discharged following the incident.</p>
